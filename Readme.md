# 🧠 RepoMind

**RepoMind** is an AI-powered code understanding and dependency analysis system designed to help developers **understand, explore, and safely modify large codebases**.

Unlike traditional code search tools, RepoMind combines **static analysis**, **dependency graphs**, and **LLM-based reasoning** to answer *why* code exists, *how* components depend on each other, and *what breaks if something changes*.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1️⃣ Intelligent Code Understanding

RepoMind parses repositories written in **Python, Java, and JavaScript** and breaks them down into meaningful units such as:

* functions
* methods
* classes
* modules

These code chunks are embedded into a vector database, allowing the system to:

* explain code behavior
* answer natural-language questions about the code
* locate relevant logic quickly

---

### 2️⃣ Dependency & Impact Analysis

RepoMind builds a **directed dependency graph** from the codebase using static analysis.

This graph captures relationships such as:

* function/method calls
* imports and dependencies
* inheritance relationships
* object instantiations

Using this graph, RepoMind can answer questions like:

* *“Which functions depend on this method?”*
* *“What parts of the system are impacted if I change this file?”*
* *“What is the call chain starting from this function?”*

This enables safer refactoring and better architectural understanding.

### 3️⃣ Hybrid Graph + AI Reasoning

RepoMind combines:

* **graph traversal** (for structural correctness)
* **vector search + LLM reasoning** (for explanation and context)

This hybrid approach ensures:

* accurate dependency tracing
* human-readable explanations
* reduced hallucinations compared to LLM-only tools

---

### 4️⃣ ⭐ Star & Save Useful Responses *(New Feature)*

RepoMind allows users to **star responses generated by the AI**.

* Starred responses are saved for later reference
* They appear in a dedicated **“Saved Insights” section** in the frontend dashboard
* This helps users build a personal knowledge base of:

  * important explanations
  * architectural decisions
  * frequently referenced code insights

This feature is especially useful for:

* onboarding
* long-term projects
* interview or review preparation

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

RepoMind follows a clean, modular pipeline:

```
Repository
   ↓
Language-specific Parsing (Python / Java / JS)
   ↓
Chunk Extraction (functions, classes, methods)
   ↓
Relation Extraction (calls, imports, inheritance)
   ↓
Dependency Graph Construction
   ↓
Vector Embeddings (code understanding)
   ↓
LLM Reasoning + Graph Queries
```

The **graph** and **vector database** are stored separately and used together during query time.

* ✅ JavaScript

(Designed to be extensible to more languages)

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

* Understanding unfamiliar or legacy codebases
* Impact analysis before refactoring
* Faster onboarding for new developers
* Explaining complex call chains
* Safer architectural changes
* Saving important insights for future reference

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **AST & Tree-sitter** for static analysis
* **NetworkX** for dependency graph construction
* **LangChain** for document handling
* **Vector Database** for semantic search
* **LLMs** for explanation and reasoning

## 📌 Why RepoMind?

Most tools either:

* search code **without understanding dependencies**, or
* explain code **without structural guarantees**

RepoMind bridges this gap by combining **static analysis precision** with **AI-powered understanding**.
